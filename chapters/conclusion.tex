Stuff to be done

In this thesis, we have investigated two interfaces, yada yada

With \midas, we did this and that stuff.
Our prototype is good and all, but there is more to be done.
- How do we integrate with other virtual memory architectures?
- Can we use physical memory permission systems?
- Using \midas for deep argument inspection for system call filters

With \seccells, we presented a mechanism for compartmentalization.
We also presented a review of mechanisms.
Compartmentalization, however, needs a lot more work.
Mechanisms might want to separate isolation and translation.
Integration with Midgard.
Work on the policy side.
Automated program compartmentalization.
Compartmentalization frameworks and description languages.
PL-based compartmentalization.
Comprehensively supporting compartmentalization in the operating system,
including fixing the system call interface as required.
