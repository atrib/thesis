Below, we present the data used for creating the scoring diagrams in
\autoref{fig:compsok:scoring_sec} and \autoref{fig:compsok:scoring_perf}.
We include descriptions for each column, which is a separate scoring factor,
and show how each mechanism scores on this feature.
For each feature, the mechanism fully satisfying the feature, or achieving
the best performance in a category gets a full circle.
Partially-filled circles show the relative score assigned to a mechanism 
for a feature, compared to the max score for that feature.
Red circles indicate a negative score, awarded when a mechanism has a
negative contribution to a feature.
