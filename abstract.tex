Computer systems rely heavily on abstraction to cope with the exponential
growth of complexity across hardware and software.
Due to practical considerations of compatibility between components of
these complex systems across generations, developers have favoured stable 
interfaces at crucial boundaries such as between hardware and software, 
and between kernel and user space.
While these interfaces have persisted across decades, the modern computing
environment has evolved significantly in terms of security and performance.
Systems are increasingly connected and share components of widely varying
provenance, and legacy interfaces are unable to counter modern threats
while maintaining strict performance objectives.
Computing requires new interfaces with stronger security guarantees which
can also support high performance applications.
In this thesis, we rethink two key interfaces to improve their security
and performance limits:
\begin{inparaenum}[\itshape i\upshape)]
  \item the kernel-user space system call interface, and
  \item the userspace virtual memory interfaces.
\end{inparaenum}

The kernel-user space system call interface suffers from double-fetch
bugs for passed-by-reference arguments stored in user memory.
Double-fetches allow a malicious user to compromise the isolation guaranteed 
at the kernel-user interface to illegally access memory,
cause kernel crashes, or to escalate its privileges.
The modern multi-user, multiprocessing environment allows the user to
change the arguments read by the kernel at different times by modifying
the contents of memory from a concurrent thread.
The complexity of the kernel makes the quest to find and fix each such bug
infeasible.
The extensibility of the kernel further exacerbates the challenge as 
third-party modules loaded by the kernel can also introduce double-fetches.
We present \midas, a systematic mitigation for kernel double-fetches which
leverages the kernel's interface to access user memory to guarantee that 
every kernel read of a user object during a system call will return the 
same value.
\midas's guarantee makes an erstwhile implicit assumption by kernel developers
explicit, protecting the kernel against a class of bugs while incurring
a $3.4\%$ overhead on diverse workloads across the NPB and PTS benchmark suites.

Whereas modern systems software runs code from a plethora of sources with
varying degrees of trust, the traditional virtual memory abstraction lacks
support for isolating untrusted parts of an application sharing the same 
virtual address space.
Consequently, buggy or malicious third-party code in a process can compromise
the process by directly leaking or modifying memory used by other components 
of the application.
The virtual memory interface needs to be redesigned to allow applications to
be compartmentalized, essentially implementing the principle of least privilege
by isolating untrusted parts of the application within compartments with 
limited access to the application's resources.
We present \seccells, a novel architectural interface for intra-address space
compartmentalization.
\seccells enables applications to define hardware-enforced memory views for 
application compartments with 
accelerated userspace instructions for inter-compartment calls.
In microbenchmarks, \seccells enables a 5-stage in-order core to switch 
compartments in only 8 cycles reducing the cost of transitions by an order
of magnitude compared to the state of the art.
We also build a full-system prototype of \seccells, based on a RISC-V 
RocketChip core running the seL4 kernel able to run userspace benchmarks.

Further, this thesis presents the first exhaustive comparison between 
compartmentalization mechanisms, evaluating both qualitative and quantitative
properties.
We describe relevant security and performance properties for practical
compartmentalization, and show how well each mechanism is able to provide each
property.
A comprehensive review of compartmentalization techniques aims to enable
computer systems developers to define a secure, performant and usable interface
to support widespread compartmentalization of applications in the future.

This thesis posits that legacy interfaces between components of modern
computing systems inhibits their security guarantees, and explores issues
at two major interfaces.
We show that principled redesign of interfaces enables the implementation of
more secure systems while supporting high-performance application needs,
with the design and implementation of \midas and \seccells to tackle challenges
at the kernel-user and intra-process interfaces respectively.
