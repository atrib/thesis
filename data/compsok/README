We can create multiple scoring plots, as specified in `axes.json`.
Each top level key corresponds to a graph named `scoring_<key>.pdf`.

Within a graph, we will create a radar plot with `n` axes as specified in the
corresponding value in `axes.json`.
For example, the key `security` has the axes `res`, `ops` and `insts`.
The spider plot will plot a bunch of mechanisms on these axes for this graph.

For each field/axis in a comparison spider plot, we will have two files:
- `feature.csv` listing classification factors and value for each mechanism
- `feature_key.json` will manage scoring, listing points for different values for a factor
