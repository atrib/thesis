%         {\textit{Me}}

% Copying Midas' paper abstract
Double-fetch bugs are a plague across all major operating system kernels. 
These bugs occur when data is fetched twice across the user/kernel trust 
boundary while allowing concurrent modification, violating an implicit
assumption at this interface.
Double-fetches enable an attacker to illegally access memory, cause 
denial of service, or to escalate privileges.
%
So far, the only protection against double-fetch bugs is to detect and fix them.
However, existing methods to find double-fetch bugs are incomplete.
%
The double-fetch problem also fundamentally prohibits efficient, kernel-based
stateful system call filtering.
Thus, we propose \emph{\midas} to mitigate double-fetch bugs and secure the
system call interface.
\midas creates on-demand
snapshots and copies of accessed data, enforcing the key invariant
that throughout a system call's lifetime, every read to a userspace object
will return the same value.

\midas shows no noticeable drop in performance when evaluated on compute-bound
workloads. 
On system call heavy workloads, \midas incurs~0.2--14\% performance overhead, 
while protecting the kernel against any \tocttou attacks. 
On average, \midas shows a~$3.4\%$ overhead on diverse workloads across two 
benchmark suites.

\chapter{SoK: Classifying Compartmentalization Mechanisms}
\label{ch:compsok}

% Copying abstract from CompSOK
Compartmentalization is the next major frontier of defense for 
modern applications, providing security based on the principles of 
least privilege and defense in depth
% While the idea of least privilege originates in the 1970s, 
in the modern era of extensive code sharing and internet-connected devices.
%  has
% highlighted the potential of security through compartmentalization.
% Simultaneously, improvements in transistor counts have allowed architects to
% implement more checks in hardware at low overheads.
Compartmentalized applications rely on isolation between compartments,
enforced by mechanisms through checks restricting a compartment's operations 
to those allowed by a policy.
These checks aim to limit each compartment's privileges and ensure that 
interactions between compartments conform to the developer's intentions.
Practically, the assorted commercial and research offerings for 
compartmentalization mechanisms vary greatly in their design goals and 
offer support for restricting different classes of privileges, and to
different degrees.
This fragmentation hinders the development of hardware based on a
common mechanism for greater adoption within the application ecosystem.

% Simultaneously, improvements in transistor counts have allowed architects to
% implement more checks in hardware at low overheads.

This chapter classifies the checks mitigating various attack vectors 
for inter-compartment attacks into three major heads:
restrictions on executable operations, their operands, and the resources 
accessed by these operations.
We systematically score \nmechs{} mechanisms, 
chosen from commercially available and state-of-the-art proposals, 
on axes measuring how comprehensively they implement checks for each 
category of restrictions listed above, how fast these checks are,
and the limitations of these checks.
From this comparison, we highlight the commonalities and difference
between the surveyed mechanisms, and underscore common weaknesses
to highlight opportunities for future mechanisms to improve upon.

\chapter{SecureCells: A Secure Compartmentalized Architecture}
\label{ch:seccells}
% \epigraph{The real cool stuff was already done.}%
%         {\textit{Me}}

% Copying securecells' paper abstract here
Modern programs are monolithic, combining code of varied provenance without 
isolation, all the while running on network-connected devices. 
A vulnerability in any component may compromise code and data of all other 
components. 
Compartmentalization separates programs into fault domains with limited 
policy-defined permissions, following the principle of least privilege, 
preventing arbitrary interactions between components. 
Unfortunately, existing compartmentalization mechanisms target weak attacker 
models, incur high overheads, or overfit to specific use cases, precluding 
their general adoption. 
The need of the hour is a secure, performant, and flexible mechanism on which 
developers can reliably implement an arsenal of compartmentalized software. 

We present SecureCells, a novel architecture for intra-address space 
compartmentalization. 
SecureCells enforces per-Virtual Memory Area (VMA) permissions for secure and
scalable access control, and introduces new userspace instructions for 
secure and fast compartment switching with hardware-enforced call gates and 
zero-copy permission transfers. 
SecureCells enables novel software mechanisms for call stack maintenance and 
register context isolation. 
In microbenchmarks, SecureCells switches compartments in only 8 cycles on a 
5-stage in-order processor, reducing the switching cost by an order of magnitude
compared to the state-of-the-art. 
Consequently, SecureCells helps secure high-performance software such as an 
in-memory key-value store with negligible overhead of less than $3\%$.
